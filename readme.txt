  * The biggest online retailer in the world (Amazon) is also the single biggest review site in the world - no coincidence. 
  * The world’s largest travel site (Trip Advisor) is built on reviews alone and has over 170 million reviews. 
  * 82% of people now consider online reviews as valuable or extremely valuable when making a purchase decision. 
  * Online reviews are simply modern day word of mouth - embrace it, it’s a game changer.

This doesn’t just apply to the big sites: 
  * 63% of customers are more likely to make a purchase from a business whose site has customer reviews. 
  * Consumer reviews are 12 times more trusted than descriptions that come from the business itself.
